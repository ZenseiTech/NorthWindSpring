## Microsoft Northwind Traders Backend API

This is going to be a backend for a web app written using the javascript library [w2ui.com/web].
This is to showcase how intuitive, lightweight and easy is to create web applications for the desktop.
I wouldn't recommend it for mobile though.

As a database is using a sample of the famous Microsoft NorthWind Traders database that was ported to SQLite

Technologies used are: Spring, SpringBoot, SpringData JPA
